<h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm Daniel Rollins, a software developer and programming enthusiast based in Leeds, UK.</p>
<p>I am currently working at <a href="www.financialforce.com">FinancialForce</a> where I help design and build middleware for cross-product integration on the Salesforce platform.</p>
<p>I have a strong personal interest in	systems programming languages such as C, C++ and Rust and am passionate about Linux and Open Source software.</p>
<p>When not programming or learning I enjoy strategy gaming, tinkering with electronics and chilling out with my wife, Hazel.</p>
