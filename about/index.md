About
=====
I'm Daniel Rollins, a software developer and programming enthusiast based in Leeds, UK.

I am currently working at [FinancialForce](www.finacialforce.com) where I help design and build middleware for cross-product integration on the Salesforce platform using Apex and Javascript.

I have a strong personal interest in systems programming languages such as C and C++ and am very passionate about Linux and Open Source software.

When not programming or learning, I enjoy strategy gaming, tinkering with electronics and bingeing on TV box sets with my wife.

## This site
On this site you will (soon) find my CV and portfolio as well as my blog that documents the journey to satisfy my endless curiosity around the subjects of C and C++, systems programming and games development.

This site was built using Jekyll and is hosted on Github Pages. The design was heavily inspired by [Karol Kuczmarski's Blog](http://xion.io/) and the [Kiko-plus](https://github.com/AWEEKJ/Kiko-plus) theme.
